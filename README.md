Set up your [react-native-debugger](https://github.com/istvanmakary/react-native-debugger) to transfer device events to your debugger server.

When the first log was transferred, the device will appear as a connected device in the **Connected devices** section of the debugger server UI.

To see device logs open **CONSOLE**!

## Export Device Logs
Each device device log can be downloaded from the debugger server by clicking on the **Download** button. It will gather the logs of the selected device and export it to a json file. These logs can be uploaded to the debugger server later.

## Upload Device Logs
 You can upload your previously downloaded logs, by clicking on upload log file input. The imported device will appear in the connected device list.
